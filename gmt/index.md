#BreakDancer

---

BreakDancer, released under GPLv3, is a Perl/C++ package that provides genome-wide detection of structural variants from Illumina paired-end sequencing reads.

BreakDancerMax predicts five types of structural variants: insertions, deletions, inversions, inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations from next-generation short paired-end sequencing reads using read pairs that are mapped with unexpected separation distances or orientation.

Please read our [paper](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v6/n9/abs/nmeth.1363.html) for a detailed description of the algorithm.
